## What this package contains

I took a smartphone development class in 2013 while getting my MS in software
engineering from Carnegie Mellon. The app I came up with was my very first
Android app and it used an open source Fourier fast transform library as the
math brains behind my implementation of an autocorrelation algorithm I came
up with after reading someone's PhD thesis on pitch detection.

Links to the FFT library I used and the PhD thesis are included in my poster PDF
in this repo.

The code in the `src` folder of this repo is not a complete Android app; it
only contains the FFT library and my code so you can see the important parts
of the algorithm and not get distracted by ancient Android stuff that probably
doesn't work any more.


## Video I apparently made for the class

***PLEASE NOTE:*** I am working on creating a VTT file to add captions to the
video. If you need captions to be able to access the video's content, please
be assured I am adding them as soon as I can.

To avoid needing to listen to my horrible singing, feel free to mute or entirely
skip from 00:36 to 02:05.
